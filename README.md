# Team Project

## Workflow

1. Main branch contains stable code  
2. Separate branches are created for each module  
3. Changes are merged using Pull Requests  
4. Code review is done before merging  
5. Merge conflicts are resolved manually  

## Tools Used

- Git  
- GitHub  

## Branching Strategy

- main → Stable production-ready code  
- feature branches → Individual features or modules  

## Collaboration Process

- Each developer works on a separate branch  
- Pull Requests are created for merging changes  
- Team members review the code  
- Approved changes are merged into main branch
